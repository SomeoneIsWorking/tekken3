## Root cause

## Resolution

## Operator findings 2026-08-25 (integration session)

Discriminated the failing `tekken3_recomp_boundary_selftest` while landing this tree:

- RED at psxport `8611d756` (this repo's pin) AND at `17981527` — the failure predates the
  integration session and is caused by the landed IRQ-resume work letting `oracle_trace` continue
  past the retired DPCR stop (`0x80085DB4` / `0x1F8010F0`), not by any unlanded file here.
  `scratch/build-irq-resume` (Aug 22) is the last known-green run.
- The oracle leg no longer stops at a hardware register at all: it consumes the full 120000-step
  cycle budget ("cycle budget consumed"), leaving mapped text at step 110630 into the exception
  vector (`pc=0x000000B0`) after the last JAL to `0x800862C8` (ra=`0x80085DEC`). A jump into the
  exception vector is an UNMODELED EXCEPTION in the oracle leg, not a new measured boundary —
  do not retarget `verify_hardware_stop` to it.
- The product-side counterpart stands: whole-program boot dispatches the retail entry and aborts
  at recomp-MISS `0x80085DC4` after IRQ `0x004`; the interrupt-context resume facts added to
  `titles/tekken3/executable.json` (`caller_base_load` .. `resume_branch_target`) are the RE data
  for the fix. `tekken3_interrupt_reentry_selftest` PASSES 1/1.
- Next step: teach the oracle shim (and the product substrate seeds) the context-save call at
  `0x80085DBC` / resume at `0x80085DC4`, then retire the stale hardware-stop assertion in
  `tools/recomp_boundary.py` against the MEASURED new stop — never against the exception vector.
